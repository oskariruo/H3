<h3>ATT&CK Framework</h3>

- Model for studying activities that a threat actor is cabale of doing to infiltrate and oparate inside an enterprise environment.

- The framework provides a common taxonomy for the cybersecurity community to describe adversary behaviors. It's useful for people researching both the defensive side and the offensive side.

- The framework can be expanded to tailor to users needs.

<h3>Tactics, techniques, sub-techniques, and procedures</h3>

the 14 tactics that are used to encompass different sets of techniques:

- Reconnaissance - Gathering as much information as possible about the victim(s) of the adversary's operations

- Resource Development - Evaluating the resources employed by the adversy

- Initial Access - Assessing how the threat actor gets their first step into the victim's environment

- Execution - Threat actor runs malicious code inside the victim's environment to do harm

- Persistence - The ability for the threat actor to keep operating eventhough actions have been taken against them (reboots etc)

- Privilege Escalation - First access can happen through an unprivileged account and the access level needs to be changed in order to continue

- Defense Evasion - Actions taken to stay undetected in the victim's environment

- Credential Access - Stealing legitimate user credentials in order to gain access, create more account, disguise malicious activity etc.

- Lateral Movement - Discovering how network(s) and system(s) are configured to pivot systems in order to reach end target

- Collection - Gathering information from victim's environment in order to exfiltrate it later

- Command and Control - All techniques involving the threat actor communicating with the systems under its control

- Exfiltration - Exfiltrating information while trying to remain undetected (includes for example encryption)

- Impact - All attempts to prevent the victim from accessing his/her system

All of these tactics are made up of many techniques and sub-techniques.

The procedure is the specific way in which a threat actor implements a specific technique or sub-technique. One procedure can cover multiple techniques and sub-techniques.

<h3>The ATT&CK Matrix</h3>

- A representation of all of the tactics, their techniques and sub-techniques

- Aids in identifying the behaviours that are the sources of interest

<h3>The ATT&CK Navigator</h3>

- A tool for visualizing a threat actor's modus operandi, the behavior of a specific tool, or to generate a security exercise.

- Allows for creating and combining multiple layers in order to study the relation between tools or threat actor.

<h3>Mapping with ATT&CK</h3>

- Formbook is an infostealer that is cabable of retrieving authorization and login credentials from a web data form before the information reaches a secure server, bypassing HTTPS encryption.

- Formbook is a form-grabbing software, cabable of being effective even if the victim for example auto-fills or copy and pastes the information.
